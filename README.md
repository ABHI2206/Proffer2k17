 

**Problem Statement -**

User is at the center of every business. Identity
services are carried out in silos which involves huge amount of rework and data
management. KYC process has to be done every time user wants a service from a new
institution. 

The owner of the data i.e. user has no control
over what is being shared with whom. Financial institutions spend millions of
dollars on compliance with KYC. Above of all, non-repudiation and end consumer
data security are major concerns. This may lead to identity theft, fraud or
money laundering.

 

**Solution -**

We propose a Blockchain based Identity solution
through distributed ledgers, smart contracts, with public key infrastructure,
consensus and privacy features that can help to standardize identity management
processes, reducing cost, time and complexity.

A blockchain based ID will perform the necessary
non-repudiation and proof of verification to meet the KYC requirements for the
active wallets across borders.

·        
The Government act as the authoritative entity to assign identities like
Aadhar cards, PAN card, Passport etc. While assignment is being done, a track
of user IDs are being kept. Once the identities (for e.g. Aadhar, pan card,
voter id) are assigned, it is assumed that the KYC is being approved by the
Government / or government certified authorities then the user is registered as
KYC approved on the Blockchain.

·        
For simplicity of PoC, we are considering Aadhar as validation for KYC. 

·        
There is separate interface for all the parties involved like government,
government authorities, users/citizens

·        
User has control over its data. User controls the permission via smart
contracts

·        
User can share the data with any service inquisitor by sharing the public
key 

·        
Instant KYC can be done just by scanning the QR code 

·        
All the access rights and transactions are registered on the Blockchain
